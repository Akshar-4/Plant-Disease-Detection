**Here I will tell you how to run the program**

1. Install the dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease
2. I have already trained the model
3. Ensure that your library version and Python version match what I have used. Normally, it won't be a problem if you have the updated libraries.
4. Activate your virtual environment or make one
5. Run the program via the command: streamlit run app.py
6. Upload an image and analyze your crop image
