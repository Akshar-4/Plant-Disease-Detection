# Plant-Disease-Detection
Hello Everyone,
I'm presenting a plant disease detection program coded in Python.
Note: It can only analyze pictures of leaves of tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers.

The Python version used is 3.10.11. Along with the libraries and their functions in this particular program:
Tensorflow: Build, train, and then save the AI model
Scikit-learn: Used for data pre-processing and metrics like accuracy
pandas: Helps handle structured data and will be useful when I integrate it with IoT Sensors
numpy: Used for numerical operations
streamlit: Used for building the web interface

Kaggle was used for the dataset (Plant Village)
